Subject: Embeddings test results

Hi Sarah,  

I benchmarked two approaches:  
1. **OpenAI text-embedding-3-small** – precise but higher latency (~350ms per query).  
2. **Ollama llama3 embeddings** – faster locally (~120ms), but noisier results in my experiments.  

Recommendation: start with OpenAI embeddings for official milestone, but keep Ollama running for dev testing.  

Regards,  
Thomas
