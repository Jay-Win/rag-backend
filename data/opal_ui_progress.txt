Subject: UI scaffolding progress

Hello,  

UI scaffolding is complete. Initial views:  
- Dashboard (API health + indexed docs)  
- Query console (with model selector)  
- File management (upload + delete)  

Questions for Marco:  
- Can you confirm if the `/files/index-status` endpoint supports filtering by filename?  
- Should I add **X-API-KEY** as default header, or keep optional?  

Thanks,  
Julia
